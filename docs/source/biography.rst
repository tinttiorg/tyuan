Biography
=========



Dr. Ting Yuan is the Chairman and Chief Scientist of the UniverSee Science Technology Inc., a Sensor Fusion Driven autonomous system solution provider. He has more than 15 years industrial/academia experience in Object Tracking, Sensor Fusion and Localization for aerospace and automotive applications. He had been a Research Scientist at the `Mercedes Benz Research Development North America`_ Inc., Sunnyvale, CA and principal Tech Lead for Autonomous Driving on China situations within the Autonomous Driving Department for nearly a decade, where his fields of endeavor lie in detection, classification and tracking of moving/static objects using information from camera, Radar and Lidar systems, as well as sensor fusion for the multi-sensor systems. He received his Ph.D. degree from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the `University of Connecticut`_, Storrs, Connecticut, USA. He holds an Associate Professorship (research line) at the SEIEE department of the `Shanghai Jiao Tong University`_ and currently the director of SSF (smart sensor fusion for autonomous systems) research laboratory.
